## 欢迎来到我的主页
<p>Hello! I'm Liu Ning. Welcome to my page! I was born in 1995 and have loved nature and physics since childhood. I even built my own telescope in elementary school. I earned a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the Department of Physics at Beijing Normal University. Currently, I work as a university teacher and researcher, teaching courses such as Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and College Physics. My research focuses on using Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC), a highly controllable quantum system, to simulate and explore a wide range of physical phenomena by precisely manipulating interactions, topological structures, and non-equilibrium dynamics within BEC.</p>
